Interpolation - Unity

This project shows different examples of interpolation/tween functions.
These functions are based on Robert Penner's Easing Functions: http://robertpenner.com/easing/

Each function takes a parameter of t between (0.0 - 1.0) and returns the current interpolation value at that point.
